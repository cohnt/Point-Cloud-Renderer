# Purpose
This purpose of this program is to render 3D point clouds in real time with user control of the viewpoint.

# Controls
Not yet implemented.

# Inspiration
The engine itself is heavily based off a previous project of mine, found here: https://github.com/TheNarcissisticArsonist/3D-Parametric-Curve-Plotter

Much of the code is reused.
