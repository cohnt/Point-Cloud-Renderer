# Purpose
This purpose of this program is to render 3D point clouds in real time with user control of the viewpoint.

# Controls
There are two aspects the user can control -- the camera's position and its orientation. To physically move the camera side-to-side, you can click and drag the screen. To move forward and backward, use the scroll wheel. To change the camera's orientation, hold down the shift key and move the mouse. To rotate the camera laterally, use, the Q and E keys. The W and S keys zoom the camera in and out (increase and decrease the field of view).

# Inspiration
The engine itself is heavily based off a previous project of mine, found here: https://github.com/TheNarcissisticArsonist/3D-Parametric-Curve-Plotter

Much of the code is reused.
